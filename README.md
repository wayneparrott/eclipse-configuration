## CodeMix & DevStyle Preferences
My typical Eclipse IDE setup has evolved of the years to include influences from JetBrains and Visual Studio Code tools. For example, I prefer to do the majority of my work within a single common Eclipse perspective including debug activities. The experience is more similar to tools like Android Studio. From VS Code I like the dark theme, cleaner search dialog, command palette and terminal integration. From Eclipse I still rely heavily on the Java & XML tools and occasionally GIT tools. Almost all other programming tasks use the CodeMix editors for a VS Code editing experience.
